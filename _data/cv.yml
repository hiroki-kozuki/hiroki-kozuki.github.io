    - title: Scientific Researcher (Beamline for Schools)
      institution: European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and German Electron Synchrotron (DESY)
      year: Sep 2020 - Oct 2020
      description:
        - Conducted a two-weeks, full-time research as part of the winning team (Nations' Flying Foxes) of the 2019-2020 Beamline for Schools Competition at CERN in collaboration with DESY using state-of-the-art facilities. Carried out research alongside professional researchers, PhD mentors, and the other winning team from Germany in a hybrid work environment. 
        - Investigated the synthesis of a Î”+ baryon in the inelastic scattering between a stationary proton source and a high-energy electron beam. 
        - The experience entailed calibration of equipment, manual theoretical calculations, statistical data analysis via Python and Jupyter Notebook, group research sessions, frequent feedback meetings, and series of presentations to collaborators, sponsors, organisers, CERN's head of HR, and the director of DESY.
