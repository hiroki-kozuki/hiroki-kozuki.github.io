Hello, I'm Hiroki Kozuki, a Japanese 2nd year undergraduate student at Imperial College London pursuing a degree in Physics with Theoretical Physics.

I created this website as an archive for my project protfolios, CV, essays, hobbies, and some (hopefully) interesting things about myself, all found in one place. 

As a starter, I will introduce my background and main interests. 

I was born in Tokyo and lived in Yokohama and Geneva for 7 and 11 years respectively before moving to London to pursue my university education. 

My academic interests span from the broad depths of physics to maths, programming, chemistry, and many other STEM areas, with a focus on high-energy physics (I like smashing particles together). 

On a more casual note, I enjoy reading philosophy books, Japanese literature, some popular science books, and Sci-Fi. I'm also quite a big fan of anime with my favourite franchise being "Ghost in the Shell".

My career aspiration is to become a researcher with doors opened to either academia or industry R&D. (Or perhaps both!)

I hope you enjoy your time here, and feel free to contact me if you have any queries or ideas for collaboration :D
